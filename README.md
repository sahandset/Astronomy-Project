# Astronomy-Project
Sahand Setareh and William Dellinger

Using AstroQuery and MatPlotLib libraries we plotted the course of planets travelling in our solar system over a time period of 10 years. 

We scaled down the Sun (for reasons of visibility, the sun's mass far outclasses any planet in the solar system) and we had to account for making all the planets visible while still charting their positions and labeling them in a legend. 

Background research can be found in the corresponding Notebook file
